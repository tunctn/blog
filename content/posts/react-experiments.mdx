# React Experiments and Interactive Demos

One of the best things about this blog setup is the ability to seamlessly blend written content with interactive demonstrations. This post explores different approaches to showcasing React experiments.

## Inline Interactive Components

Sometimes you want to embed a simple interactive element directly in your post:

<InteractiveDemo title="State Management Demo">
  This demonstrates how React state works with a simple counter. The state is preserved as you interact with the component, making it perfect for educational content.
</InteractiveDemo>

## Linking to Dedicated Experiments

For more complex demonstrations, I can create dedicated experiment pages. For example, check out my [spinning cube experiment](/experiments/spinning-cube) which demonstrates 3D CSS animations.

These dedicated pages allow for:
- More complex interactions
- Full-screen experiences  
- Detailed documentation
- Performance optimizations

## The Best of Both Worlds

This architecture gives me incredible flexibility:

1. **Simple posts** - Just write Markdown when that's all I need
2. **Enhanced posts** - Drop in `<InteractiveDemo />` components for quick demos
3. **Dedicated experiments** - Create full pages under `/experiments/` for complex showcases
4. **Seamless integration** - Link between posts and experiments naturally

The key insight from my friend at Apple was keeping things simple by default, but having the escape hatch to full React interactivity whenever needed. No complex build processes or separate systems - just Next.js doing what it does best.

## Next Steps

I'm planning to build more experiments around:
- 3D graphics with Three.js
- Data visualizations with D3
- Interactive code editors
- Game mechanics
- UI component showcases

Each one will be a mix of educational blog content and hands-on demonstrations. The best way to learn is by building and sharing!
