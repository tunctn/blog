# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using the new MDX setup. I can write regular Markdown content, but I can also embed interactive React components directly in my posts.

## Interactive Components

Here's an example of an interactive component embedded right in the post:

<InteractiveDemo title="My First Demo">
  This is some custom content inside the demo component!
</InteractiveDemo>

## Code Examples

I can also include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
const greet = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Regular Markdown

Of course, all regular Markdown features work too:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links to other pages](/about)
- Images
- Lists
- And much more!

This setup gives me the flexibility to write simple Markdown when I need it, but also drop in interactive React components whenever inspiration strikes. Perfect for technical blog posts where I want to demonstrate concepts with live examples.
